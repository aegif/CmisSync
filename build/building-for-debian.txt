TODO: Investigate http://www.asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/ or even better build from Debian source package

Build CmisSync normally, including `make install`, then copy all installed files:

mkdir cmissync_2.0-0
cd cmissync_2.0-0
mkdir -p usr/local/bin
cp /usr/local/bin/cmissync usr/local/bin/
mkdir usr/local/lib
cp -r /usr/local/lib/cmissync usr/local/lib/
mkdir usr/local/share
cp -r /usr/local/share/cmissync/ usr/local/share/
mkdir usr/local/share/applications
cp /usr/local/share/applications/cmissync.desktop usr/local/share/applications/

Then update the version number in DEBIAN/control and run:

dpkg-deb --build cmissync_2.0-0
